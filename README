To install DOS VA, First you need to set up the Terminal.

This method will describe one of the ways you can install DOSVA.

First you need to setup the CP. (Command Processor)

You can use the following commands to install the COMMAND PROCESSOR onto PATH.

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/DOSva/bin/

export DOSHOME="/path/to/DOSva"

export DOSLIB="/path/to/DOSva"
The reason we set home variables, is because we want to use DOSva anywhere.

After, you've installed the DOSVA command processor, you can simply type "DOS" and it will run.

(this method also allows you to mess with the `initramfs` unit)
